#### EXCERPTS

Over the last six months, we’ve seen such a dataset emerge from users of Quick, Draw!, Google’s latest approach to helping wide, international audiences understand how neural networks work. A group of Googlers designed Quick, Draw! as a way for anyone to interact with a machine learning system in a fun way, drawing everyday objects like trees and mugs. The system will try to guess what their drawing depicts, within 20 seconds. While the goal of Quick, Draw! was simply to create a fun game that runs on machine learning, it has resulted in 800 million drawings from twenty million people in 100 nations, from Brazil to Japan to the U.S. to South Africa.
